    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>
        This should be the body for CSS. 
        <br>Style tag refers to css. When tagging 'style' we can use css functions in webpage.
        <br>However, when style tag is in between HTML lines, it is one of the attributes of HTML. When style is tagged alone, it needs {} which indicates the attributes that belong in that specific function of CSS. {} is called 'Selector', and function inside it is called 'Declaration'. 
        <p>
            Declaration : Declaration consists of property and value. For example, 'color' would be a property and 'red' would be a value.
        </p>
        <p>
            **In the 7th session, we transformed all 'a' links to black and visited links to gray. For the link that's been currently visited, we turned it red.
            <br> <strong>*1st method</strong>
            <br>- To do this, we put '.' infront of the class to indicate that it's a 'class'. And then we put 'class =saw' in the HTML line
            <br>- To turn current link red, we put another class named 'active' in HTML line and add '.active' as red in css line
            <br>- The order of classes in css line matters, as classes written in HTML line follows last order in css line first.
            <br> <strong>*2nd method</strong>
            <br>- 'id' selector : put id='active' in HTML and indicate #active in css line. The order of reflection is id>class>tag. If the class of all the selectors are the same, the css line reflects the last written order.
            <br>- id should be the 'one and only' value. Therefore, value 'active' shouldn't be used again.
            <br>- Because of this hierarchy, we can put exceptions as id and put broad considerations as tag

        </p>
        <p>
            **Then we made box, learned how to draw borders and partial borders, and now we move on to how we place paragraphs on the left hand side of the website.
            <br> In css line, grid ol{} means the funtion is effective on ol tag that has 'grid' as a parent.
        
        </p>
        <p>
            **''div'occupies the entire line, whereas 'span' tag occupies only the words that go inside the tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>+Additional information :</strong>
            <br>Setting different file for style as css will be more convenient, as we can just visit the file and change some attributes to edit numerous html files with that style. 
            <br>Putting css scripts inside html file is more efficient traffic-wise. 
            <br>However, by downloading the css file in our computer it recalls this saved file every time this file is needed. This is called 'Caching'. Therefore the computer shows webpage faster without having to tradeoff with the traffic size(user fee).
